# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to modify starter code in JavaScript to produce an application that allows for employee payroll data to be viewed and managed after entry. In order to achieve this, we were required to use multple principles of JavaScript including variables, objects, arrays and while loops.

## Usage

This webpage can be used to enter employee data and see it displayed in a table upon completion. In order to start the application simply click the blue "add employee data" button in the center of the page. From there, you may enter the first name, last name, and salary of your employee. You will be prompted to add another employee after entering the salary, and the process will continue should you click "ok". When you have entered data for all of your employees, clicking "cancel" on the "add another employee" prompt will end the data entry. This wil produce a table that displays the employee data in the center of the page. In the console log, you will also find an average salary of all employees as well as a message announcing the name of a random employee selected as a winner for a random drawing!
